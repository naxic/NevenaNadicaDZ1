Project as a part of Dataflow computers and their application course.

    Implementation of an algorithm for Kernel that takes a single input stream x and applies a simple function 
    f(x) = 5*X^3 - 6*X^2 + 2*X - 1 in Maxeler Technologies
    Demonstration of dataflow computing
    Execution on Maxeler platform

Done in collaboration Nevena Bojovic and Nadica Milinkovic
